Takeaway: Validity - tests a known construct.  Reliability - how closely grouped results are.  Usability - how easy it is to use. You can only have 2 of them.  Test your interviews on your existing team. Have a scoring rubric for the interview to minimise variance and bias. Don't debrief as a group until you have written down feedback.  Interviewers will come to the same conclusion so they don't look stupid.  Share all feedback at once.

Takeaway: Don't lie to candidates. Find out what they don't like and be honest if that is the environment you have.

Takeaway: In a power based situation, the quality of the relationship is owned by the person with the power. Much of what we do as developers is not coding - we should test for those things in the interview. Remove conclusions in feedback you can't support with evidence. Remember interviewing is stressful and people are doing their best. Interviewer needs to be good at time management.

## Onboarding

### Articles

- [Kate Heddleston - Onboarding and the Cost of Team Debt](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/onboarding-and-the-cost-of-team-debt)
Takeaway: Each person who is not fully onboarded, integrated or managed leads to team debt. If team debt gets too high, then the team may need to stop work to get properly trained. Onboarding is finished when reliable independence is achieved. Reiterating processes when someone new joins helps realign existing members as well as new ones.

- [Patrick Kua - Onboarding Strategies](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/category/onboarding-strategies/)
Takeaway: Good series of strategies for onboarding new team members.  Maintaining a list of technical debt that is shared with new team members.  Catalogues of patterns in use.  Preparation email of tech stack, tools, patterns etc.
