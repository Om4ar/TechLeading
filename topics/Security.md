[OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/). Be aware of how to use the framework you use securely. Build reusable security controls. Use checklists for secure coding - keep them short. Write unit tests for security. Use security static analysis tools - use only a small set of highly important rules.
