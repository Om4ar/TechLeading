Takeaway: 4 part approach to working and evaluating technical debt based around the business value it offers. Evaluate where you are with all stakeholders present. Work out what the business goals are. Measure how bad it is in the code. Improve readability first. Keep using the same metrics when you come to fix things (and after). Everything in dealing with tech debt comes back to organisational culture.

## Books

Takeaway: The use of checklists dramatically raises effectiveness and reduces errors. Checklists establish a higher standard of baseline performance. In the end, a checklist is only an aid. If it doesnâ€™t aid, itâ€™s not right. Concise, clear and collaborative. They are living processes and change over time.

-[Tom DeMarco & Timothy Lister - Waltzing with Bears: Managing Risk on Software Projects](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609) ðŸ’²
Takeaway: Without risk management, projects can not work out what is realisticly deliverable. Projects suffer from selective myopia about catastrophic risks. Projects often get estimated to deliver on the first day there is a non-zero chance of being finished - rather than the most likely date of delivery. Delivery dates are a window of uncertainty, the length of which is due to process noise. Use historical projects in the organisation to work out how much process noise occurs.
