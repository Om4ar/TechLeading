Takeaway: Purpose of teaching is to reduce the unknowns. Juniors need to see you don't know stuf too. Know what you are teaching - have a core book list and a recommended reading list. The lessons must build on things they already know so make sure you know where they are. Help people understand what good questions are. If they don't understand your answer, repetition won't help.
